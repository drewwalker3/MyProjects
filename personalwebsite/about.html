    <h2><u><b>About Me</b></u></h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Andrew Walker, a Software Engineering major at Georgia Southern University with a passion for technology and innovation. I specialize in game development, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, web development, and software development. I love exploring how technology can create immersive experiences and solve real-world problems.

    Beyond coding, I'm actively involved in leadership as an executive member of Phi Delta Theta, where I develop teamwork and organizational skills. I also enjoy playing basketball and spending time with friends, balancing my technical pursuits with strong social and leadership experiences.

    I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting projects and expand my knowledge. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
