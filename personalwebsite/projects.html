    <h4><u><b>Blog Generator with OpenAI (Python)</b></u></h4>
    <div class="blog-ai"></div>
    <p>This project is a Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate blog-style paragraphs based on user-provided topics. The API key is securely stored in a .env file, and the user is prompted to input topics for content generation. The program allows continuous generation of content until the user opts to exit the loop.</p>
